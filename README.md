This is currently a readMe.md file and i am just testing my new keyboard. Does it work perfectly i don't know but i am testing it for sure. Will it last, i don't know that for sure but i will try for sure. 
The quality seems flimsy for a keyboard. It is making too much sound for a new keyboard but let us see how it goes. It anyways has one year warranty which i most certainly believe it will fail. The keys are making too much sound and i amo not quite satisfied with it.

Will it work for one year i don't know but the claim of company is surely impressive. The flimsy keyboard's claim that it will work for one year will surely be tested to full

The previous keyboard hardly made any sound and this one makes too much sound but does making too much sound a disadvatage i don't know for sure. I will have to test the keyboard to full to make any meaningful judgement on its usefullness. The keys seem to be popping out. The sound is overwhelming and the resposne is poor but can the key sustain heavy abuse which will surely be coming its way.          \\
